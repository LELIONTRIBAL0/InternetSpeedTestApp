Welcome to the **Internet Speed Test App**! This application provides a quick, simple, and open-source way to check your internet performance. Unlike online browser-based tools, this app gives you direct access to vital metrics such as download and upload speeds, ping (latency), ISP and external IP address, and a link to share your Speedtest.net results.

## üöÄ New CLI Features (2025)

- Modern CLI UI with [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich): colored panels, tables, and progress spinners
- Displays local and external IP, ISP, and location before the test
- Shows server info and test time in the results table
- Friendly error handling and retry option if the test fails
- Option to save results to a file (`speedtest_results.txt`) after a successful test
- Code cleanup and improved structure
